When starting this project, I've already had experiences with Flutter, so the challenge difficulties will bypass some basic knowledge and the knowledge that I knew it already. üßë‚Äçüíª

## [Day 001](https://github.com/TaiTrien/100-days-of-flutter/tree/main/day001): Scrolling with [DraggableScrollableSheet](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/DraggableScrollableSheet-class.html) & [ListWheelScrollView](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/widgets/ListWheelScrollView-class.html)

1. **DraggableScrollableSheet**
  - Use another sizing widget beside scrolling widget to make sheet affect. Please check demo.
  - ***minChildSize***: is for smallest size that sheet can shrink and then opposite is ***maxChildSize*** from 0 to 1.
  - ***snap:true***: to turn on custom snap, ***snapSizes: List(double)*** to define points to snap when users release their finger.
